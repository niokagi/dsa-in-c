-   **Stack**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure.
-   **Queue**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure.
-   **Hash Table**: Key-value pair mapping.
-   **Tree**:
    -   Binary Search Tree (BST)
-   **Graph**:
    -   Adjacency Matrix
    -   Adjacency List

## How to Use

Each directory contains a specific data structure or algorithm. To compile and run a file, use a C compiler like GCC:

1.  **Compile the file:**
    ```sh
    gcc file_name.c -o output
    ```

2.  **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    ./output
    ```

This repository serves as personal documentation for the **"Algorithms and Data Structures"** course. It tracks my progress and understanding of the concepts taught throughout the semester.
