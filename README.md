# Data Structure and Algorithms in C

A collection of C source code implementations for fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Data Structures
-   **Array & Struct**: Basic data organization.
-   **Linked List**:
-   **Stack**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure.
-   **Queue**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure.
-   **Tree**:
    -   Binary Search Tree (BST)
-   **Graph**

### Algorithms
-   **Searching**:
    -   Linear Search
    -   Binary Search
-   **Sorting**:
    -   Bubble Sort
    -   Selection Sort
    -   Insertion Sort
    -   Merge Sort
    -   Quick Sort
-   **Graph**:
    -   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    -   Depth-First Search (DFS)

This repository serves as personal documentation for the **"Algorithms and Data Structures"** course. It tracks my progress and understanding of the concepts taught throughout the semester.
